Rshell
========

Synopsis
--------
This project is an attempt on recreating the basic command shell with C++ implementation. The program implemented in this library works by having a command prompt provided with the current user and hostname instead of just a simple '$' to imitate most SSHs. The programmed shell in this library will be able to execute single commands with optional arguments, along with the functionality of executing multiple commands using connectors (e.g ls -a && cd rshell).
